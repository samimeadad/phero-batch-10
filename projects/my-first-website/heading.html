<p>In 1980, physicist <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, a <small>contractor</small> at <strong>CERN</strong>, proposed
    and prototyped
    ENQUIRE, a system
    for
    CERN
    <em>researchers</em>
    to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4]
    Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN
    data
    systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally
    adopted
    by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
    encyclopedia is the first entry.[5]
